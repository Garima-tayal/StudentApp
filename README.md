**🚀 Generic Codebase Project**
**Tagline:** Building a robust codebase for a generic student management system 💻

**📖 Description**
The Generic Codebase Project is a comprehensive Java-based application designed to manage student records, grades, and attendance. This project aims to provide a robust foundation for building a scalable and maintainable student management system. The codebase is structured to be modular, allowing for easy extension and modification to meet specific requirements.

The project is built using a MySQL database to store student data, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The codebase includes a range of features, from basic data retrieval and manipulation to more advanced functionality such as grade calculation and attendance tracking.

**✨ Features**
1. **Student Management**: Create, read, update, and delete student records, including personal details, academic information, and attendance records.
2. **Grade Calculation**: Automatically calculate grades based on student performance in various subjects.
3. **Attendance Tracking**: Record and track student attendance, including tardiness and absences.
4. **Data Retrieval**: Retrieve student data, including grades and attendance, for easy reporting and analysis.
5. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to restrict access to sensitive data and ensure data integrity.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to prevent data corruption and ensure system stability.
7. **Modular Design**: Design the codebase to be modular, allowing for easy extension and modification to meet specific requirements.
8. **SQL Database Integration**: Integrate with a MySQL database to store and retrieve student data.
